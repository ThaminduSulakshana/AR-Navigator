AR Navigation with NavMesh and Dynamic Target Selection

This repository is "How to build an AR-based indoor navigation system with Unity and ARFoundation." This system leverages NavMesh for pathfinding, multiple dynamic navigation targets, and real-time path visualization using a LineRenderer. It features an intuitive UI with TMP_Dropdown for selecting targets and toggling visibility of navigation paths.

Key functionalities:

- Dynamic target selection using a dropdown menu.
- Real-time pathfinding without relying on cloud anchors or ARPointCloud data.
- World recentering for seamless navigation experiences.
- Easy-to-use toggle for path visibility.

This project demonstrates how to combine Unityâ€™s NavMesh with AR features to create a robust and lightweight indoor navigation solution.
